%API Design
\textbf{API Design.}
We propose a modular and extensible API that provides a well-defined interface for the LSTM model, backtesting module and for trade-creation\todo{strategy creation}. The API abstracts away low-level behaviour while exposing only essential operations required by higher-end components, following the OpenAPI specification. This design reduces integration complexity, enables consistent access across clients, and supports extensions without requiring architectural changes.

%Communication Strategy
\textbf{Communication Strategy}. We design a structured communication model based on a request/response pattern. This strategy enables efficient coordination between system modules, minimizing latency and ensures reliable message delivery under varying load conditions. By formalizing the communication, the system gains improved robustness and supports independent development and evaluation of interacting components.
