%API Design
\textbf{API Design.}
We propose a modular and extensible API that provides a well-defined interface for the LSTM model, backtesting module and for strategy-creation. The API abstracts away low-level behaviour while exposing only essential operations required by higher-end components, following the OpenAPI specification. This design reduces integration complexity, enables consistent access across clients, and supports extensions without requiring architectural changes.

%Communication Strategy
\textbf{Communication Strategy}. We design a structured communication model based on a request/response pattern. This strategy enables efficient coordination between system modules, minimizing latency and ensures reliable message delivery under varying load conditions. By formalizing the communication, the system gains improved robustness and supports independent development and evaluation of interacting components.

%LSTM Implementation
\textbf{LSTM Implementation.}
A machine learning service was developed encapsulating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\todo{abbreviation consistency} network using TensorFlow. To address the non-stationary nature of financial time series, the implementation incorporates an automated preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw asset prices into logarithmic returns ($r_t = \ln(P_t / P_{t-1})$) prior to normalization via Min-Max scaling. The architecture utilizes a configurable sliding window approach for sequence generation, where a lookback parameter defines the number of historical observations used to predict the next value. The training pipeline supports configurable hyperparameters including the number of LSTM layers, hidden units, dropout rate, and batch size.
