\section{Introduction}
Time series prediction has become a critical component of various modern analytical and decision making systems. Whether the task is to forecasts weather or energy demand, anticipate component failure in mechanical systems, or understand and predict financial market dynamics, the ability to model future data is a major advantage in most domains, and improves system performance and informed decisions. Regardless of the application, the efficiency of forecasting and decision making depends on methods capable of capturing structure in temporal data.

Recently, machine learning models have begun to compete with classical statistical and quantitative models as methodology for time series prediction. Traditional quantitative strategies rely on technical analysis to identify historical patterns through statistical indicators \cite{Ariyo2014}. Although interpretable, these linear methods often fail to capture complex market dynamics. In contrast, deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at modeling non-linear dependencies \cite{Hochreiter1997}. However, standalone machine learning models frequently suffer from overfitting and lack of transparency in decision-making \cite{Fischer2018}.

``Hybrid strategies'' that integrate deterministic technical indicators with probabilistic machine learning predictions offer a potential solution to these limitations \cite{Sezer2020}. Such strategies aim to take advantage of the strengths of both domains and address the shortcomings of each approach in isolation, allowing construction of models that are interpretable and accurate across various time series application domains.

To facilitate the investigation of the efficacy of using hybrid strategies for time series modeling, a modular platform was developed that integrates LSTM inference directly into a strategy builder. This system allows for the composition of logical dataflows in which machine learning predictions serve as auxiliary signals alongside traditional quantitative models within a broader technical framework.
