Working with financial market data requires reliable data providers with high-quality data available. While many provider options are available, the primary considerations were Yahoo Finance, EODHD and Massive (formerly Polygon.io) for stock data, along with Coinbase and Binance for crypto currency data. For crypto currency data, the most consistent dataset, at least for Bitcoin (BTC), was sourced from Coinbase. Regarding stock data, the selected provider was Massive, as they provide access to consistent historical data across the American stock market. Due to both providers being free to use, along with their consistent data quality, made them the selected providers for the crypto currency market and stock market, respectively.

Since financial time series data is often represented through the Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) format, and the aim of the project is to make a general purpose time series prediction framework, this format must be generalized. To represent financial market data as general purpose time series, each OHLC entry is split in multiple series, where each serie only has a single vector of data points.
